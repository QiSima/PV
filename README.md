# Multi-scale Fused Graph Convolutional Network for Multi-site Photovoltaic Power Forecasting
This is the origin Pytorch implementation of the paper "Multi-scale Fused Graph Convolutional Network for Multi-site Photovoltaic Power Forecasting". Here, a novel and effective spatiotemporal model is constructed for multi-site photovoltaic power forecasting. The full open-source code will be made available upon publication of the paper.
